# Automobile-Carbondioxide-Emission-Estimation-Using-Categorical-Boosting-CatBoost-
This project aimed to support environmental sustainability by accurately predicting vehicle CO₂ emissions using machine learning techniques. A CatBoost regression model was trained on real-world automobile datasets incorporating key vehicle parameters such as engine size, fuel type, transmission type, and fuel consumption. The data undergoes extensive cleaning and preprocessing, followed by training the model. The resulting model achieved strong predictive accuracy, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.23 g/km, Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) of 5.64 g/km and an R² score of 0.9920. To ensure accessibility, the system was deployed through a Flask-based web interface that enables users to make real-time predictions via a simple HTML form. Additionally, predictions were categorized using CAFE-II norms to indicate whether the emission level was environmentally acceptable or excessive, enhancing interpretability and encouraging eco-conscious decision-making among manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers.
